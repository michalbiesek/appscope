     * intended to flush the instruction pipeline befiore
     * calling rdtsc.
     *
     * A serializing instruction is used as the order of
     * execution is not guaranteed. It's described as
     * "Out ofOrder Execution". In some cases the read
     * of the TSC can come before the instruction being
     * measured. That scenario is not very likely for us
     * as we tend to measure functions as opposed to
     * statements.
     *
     * If the rdtscp instruction is available, we use it.
     * It takes a bit longer to execute due to the extra
     * serialization instruction (cpuid). However, it's
     * supposed to be more accurate.
